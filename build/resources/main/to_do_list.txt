—Add castling (MoveLogic)

—Make pixel pawns smaller and more rounded

—Add BoardFlipping ability
        new class DoubleSidedBoard with two same boards but from different pov. Use this when playing

—Fix bug where Pawn cant capture diagonally to save king from check
        Maybe dont need any Pawnflip logic if we use a double-sided board?
        Pawn can also move forward when pinned
        Hypothetically both of these bugs can be solved by using a two-sided board. Will require a LOT of refactoring

—Go through every class and resolve warnings
