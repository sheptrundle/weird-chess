**Weird Chess by Shep Trundle**

This is a personal project made using Java and JavaFX through IntelliJ. The entire chess board, game, and piece art were all coded/drawn by myself from scratch. 

The game allow players to play chess with crazy gamemodes or variations and will continually be updated with new gamemodes.

I hope to add online gameplay in real time against other players in the future, potentially transforming this application into a website.
