—Add castling (MoveLogic)

—Make pixel pawns smaller and more rounded

-Fix major bugs with piece movement during check, check highlights, and checkmates on TwoWayBoard
    I think most of these bugs are only issues from black pov???

—Fix bug where Pawn cant capture diagonally to save king from check
        Maybe dont need any Pawnflip logic if we use a double-sided board?
        Pawn can also move forward when pinned
        Hypothetically both of these bugs can be solved by using a two-sided board. Will require a LOT of refactoring

—Go through every class and resolve warnings
